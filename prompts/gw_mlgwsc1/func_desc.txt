The pipeline function processes gravitational wave data from the H1 and L1 detectors to identify potential gravitational wave signals. It takes strain_h1 and strain_l1 numpy arrays containing detector data, and times array with corresponding time points. The function returns a tuple of three numpy arrays: peak_times containing GPS times of identified events, peak_heights with significance values of each peak, and peak_deltat showing time window uncertainty for each peak.
