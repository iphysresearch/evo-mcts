## Task Overview
Generate optimized technical guidelines for gravitational wave detection algorithms through systematic analysis of multi-generational reflection insights. Focus on enhancing data conditioning pipelines, time-frequency analysis methods, noise suppression techniques, and H1-L1 detector coherence optimization. Produce executable directives addressing: waveform recognition precision, computational complexity management, and non-stationary noise differentiation while maintaining strict API compliance.

## Input Context
1. NEW INSIGHTS FROM RECENT ITERATIONS:
   - Formatted as performance-annotated entries: [Parent N Reflection | Score: X]<reflection>
   - Time-ordered weighting (newest=highest priority) with objective score-based ranking
   - Includes full technical post-mortems from immediate ancestors
{parent_reflections}

2. LONG-TERM REFLECTION REPOSITORY:
   - Contains battle-tested insights from top 1% performers
   - 3x weighting factor for architectural-level insights
   - Curated through 3-stage filtration: 
     1. Statistical significance validation
     2. Cross-generational effectiveness verification
     3. Compatibility check with current detector configurations

## Implementation Requirements
1. Perform weighted synthesis of reflections
2. Generate 3-5 technically-grounded optimization directives
3. Prioritize:
   - Mitigation of historical implementation flaws
   - Amplification of proven effective patterns
   - Weighted integration of multi-generational insights

## Output Format
- Return all guidelines within SINGLE BRACE
- Ensure entire response can be parseable by regex: \\{{(.*?)\\}} with DOTALL flag
- Concrete technical directives only
- No explanatory text or formatting
