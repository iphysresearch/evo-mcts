## Task Overview
Generate depth-specific optimization hints for gravitational wave detection algorithms by synthesizing multi-level reflections. 
Current Optimization Depth: {parent_depth}/{max_depth} (shallow: structural patterns, medium: implementation techniques, deep: mathematical details)

## Contextual Insights
1. Peer Algorithm Reflections (Depth {parent_depth}):
   - Formatted as performance-annotated entries: [No.N Brother Reflection | Score: X]<reflection>
   - Time-ordered weighting (newest=highest priority) with objective score-based ranking
   - Includes full technical post-mortems from immediate ancestors
{parent_reflections}

2. Father Algorithm Analysis (Depth {father_depth}):
{father_reflection}

## Hint Generation Requirements
1. Produce 3-5 executable optimization directives that:
   - Integrate cross-depth insights from peer implementations
   - Target {parent_depth}-level (shallow: structural patterns, medium: implementation techniques, deep: mathematical details) components for improvement
   - Formulate mathematically sound enhancements
   - Align with gravitational wave data processing objectives

2. Output Format Rules
   - Return optimization strategies within SINGLE BRACE
   - Ensure entire response can be parseable by regex: \\{{(.*?)\\}} with DOTALL flag
   - Focus on {parent_depth}-appropriate modifications
   - Emphasize time-domain processing optimizations

## Critical Constraints
- Each directive must correspond to concrete code changes
- Explicitly connect to reflection insights where applicable
- Maintain strict {parent_depth}-level focus in all suggestions
- Exclude explanatory text within the hint brace
- Prioritize modifications matching current depth's optimization type
