## Task Overview
Leverage insights from prior strategic reflection to architecturally enhance the gravitational wave detection algorithm. Develop improvements that directly address identified limitations in CRITICAL REFLECTION INSIGHTS while preserving core functionality through:

1. Stage-level architectural modifications informed by reflection analysis
2. Reflection-driven noise reduction and coherence enhancement strategies
3. Time-frequency analysis variations targeting specific weaknesses identified
4. H1-L1 synthesis improvements based on cross-detector insights

Generate architecturally distinct variants that implement reflection-derived concepts through fundamental structural changes.

## Input Context
1. CRITICAL REFLECTION INSIGHTS (Improvement Basis):
```text
{reflection}
```

2. REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION:
[Description] {elite_algorithm_description}
[Baseline Code]
```python
{elite_algorithm_code}
```

## Implementation Requirements
1. Execute reflection-guided analysis:
   - Map reflection insights to specific code components
   - Identify 2-3 architectural limitations in current implementation
2. Propose improvements that directly convert reflection insights into:
   - Enhanced signal path architecture
   - Novel noise handling structures
   - Optimized computational patterns
   - Advanced detector synergy mechanisms
3. Maintain strict interface compatibility with existing system integration

## Output Format
- Place the core design idea in a sentence within a brace BEFORE the function definition
- For the core design idea format: \\{{A hybrid gravitational wave detection pipeline...}}
- Implement as Python function: {func_name}
- Inputs: {input_count} parameter(s) ({joined_inputs})
- Outputs: {output_count} return value(s) ({joined_outputs})
- Follow: {inout_inf}
- Constraints: {other_inf}
- IMPORTANT: All output code MUST be valid Python syntax. Do not place description text inside curly braces within the function body.
- Example of correct format:
  \\{{Core design description here}}
  ```python
  def pipeline_v2(strain_h1: np.ndarray, strain_l1: np.ndarray, times: np.ndarray) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
      """Core design description can alternatively be placed here as a docstring"""
      # Function implementation...
  ```

## Important Notes
- Focus on algorithmic improvements rather than code style changes
- Ensure the new implementation directly addresses the reflection insights
