I have analyzed two algorithms and provided a reflection on their differences. 

[Worse code]
{worse_code}

[Better code]
{better_code}

[Reflection]
{reflection}

Based on this reflection, please write an improved algorithm according to the reflection. 
First, describe the design idea and main steps of your algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace outside the code implementation. Next, implement it in Python as a function named '{func_name}'.
This function should accept {input_count} input(s): {joined_inputs}. The function should return {output_count} output(s): {joined_outputs}. 
{inout_inf} {other_inf}

Do not give additional explanations.
