1. **Non-linear** Processing Core Concepts:
   - Signal Transformation: 
     * Non-linear vs linear decomposition
     * Adaptive threshold mechanisms
     * Multi-scale analysis
   
   - Feature Extraction:
     * Phase space reconstruction
     * Topological data analysis
     * Wavelet-based detection
   
   - Statistical Analysis:
     * Robust estimators
     * Non-Gaussian processes
     * Higher-order statistics

2. Implementation Principles:
   - Prioritize adaptive over fixed parameters
   - Consider local vs global characteristics
   - Balance computational cost with accuracy
