{prompt_task}

Below is your prior reflection on designing heuristics for this problem:
{reflection}

Below is the current algorithm with its code and objective value:
[Algorithm's description]
{algorithm_description}
[Code]
{algorithm_code}
[Objective value]
{objective_value}

Please create a new algorithm that improves upon the provided algorithm using insights from the reflection.
First, describe the design idea and main steps of your new algorithm in one sentence. The description must be inside a brace outside the code implementation. Next, implement it in Python as a function named '{func_name}'.
This function should accept {input_count} input(s): {joined_inputs}. The function should return {output_count} output(s): {joined_outputs}. 
{inout_inf} {other_inf}

Do not give additional explanations.
