## Seed Function Analysis Task
Analyze the foundational algorithm's design strategy to establish baseline understanding for MCTS exploration. This first-level analysis will guide subsequent optimization directions.

## Seed Function Implementation
```python
{prompt_seed_func}
```
- **Technical implementation details**: {prompt_other_inf}
- **Performance impact rationale**: {prompt_inout_inf}

## Context for Analysis
This initial analysis at MCTS depth first-level should:
- Identify core algorithmic mechanisms
- Extract fundamental processing stages
- Surface high-level optimization opportunities
- Establish baseline for diversity generation
{external_knowledge}

## Analysis Requirements
1. Characterize the seed's core approach in one sentence containing:
   - Primary computational strategy
   - Key transformation stages
   - Fundamental signal processing techniques
   - Overall optimization philosophy

2. Focus on architectural-level characteristics rather than implementation details

3. Description must fit within single braces and avoid:
   - Code references
   - Parameter-level details
   - Performance assessments
   - Comparative statements

## Output Format Rules
- Return optimization strategies within SINGLE BRACE
- Ensure entire response can be parseable by regex: \\{{(.*?)\\}} with DOTALL flag
