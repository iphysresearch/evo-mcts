{prompt_task}

Below are two versions of a function that solves the problem:

[Worse code]
{code_worse}

[Better code]
{code_better}

Compare these two implementations and provide hints for designing better heuristics in less than 20 words. Your hints must be inside inside a brace. Focus on key improvements that could be made to the worse version.

Only provide the hints inside braces. 

Do not give additional explanations.
